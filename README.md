# Google-Data-Analytic-Case-Study-Cyclistic
This Google data analytics capstone project integrates the utilization of PostgreSQL and Tableau for comprehensive data cleaning and analytics.

## Project Overview
Brief description of your project, its goals, and why it exists.

## Project Scenario
As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The director of marketing and my manager assigned me to this business question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
